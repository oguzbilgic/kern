# kern

AI agents built for coworking.

One brain across every channel. Your agent sits in Slack channels, Telegram DMs, the terminal, and the browser. It knows who's talking, reads the room, and remembers everything. Humans and agents, same channels, same conversation.

## Why kern

Most agent frameworks give you sessions that reset, memory that's a black box, or infrastructure you have to manage. kern takes a different approach:

- **One brain** — a single continuous session across every interface. Message from Telegram, pick up in the terminal, continue in the browser. The agent always knows what happened.
- **Context-aware** — the agent knows who's talking and where. It sees the user, the channel, and the interface — so it can adjust tone, filter context, and keep track of different conversations within the same session.
- **A folder is the agent** — AGENTS.md defines behavior, IDENTITY.md defines who it is, knowledge/ and notes/ are its memory. Everything is plain text, git-tracked, and inspectable.
- **No infra** — no server, no database, no vector store. A folder, an API key, and `npm install -g kern-ai`.

kern pairs with [agent-kernel](https://github.com/oguzbilgic/agent-kernel) — the kernel defines how an agent remembers, kern runs it.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g kern-ai
kern init my-agent
kern tui
```

The init wizard scaffolds your agent, asks for a provider and API key, then starts it. `kern tui` opens an interactive chat. `kern web start` opens it in the browser.

For automation: `kern init my-agent --api-key sk-or-...` (no prompts, defaults to openrouter + opus 4.6).

## How it works

```
TUI ──────────────┐
Web UI ───────────┤
Telegram DM ──────┤── kern ── one session ── one folder
#engineering ─────┤
Slack DM ─────────┘
```

Every interface feeds into the same session. The agent reads and writes its own memory files through tools — takes notes, updates knowledge, commits to git. The next time you talk to it, from any interface, it picks up exactly where it left off.

## Agent structure

After `kern init`, your agent directory looks like:

```
my-agent/
  AGENTS.md              # how the agent behaves (system prompt)
  IDENTITY.md            # who the agent is
  KNOWLEDGE.md           # index of what it knows
  USERS.md               # paired users with roles and guardrails
  knowledge/             # mutable state files
  notes/                 # daily logs (append-only)
  .kern/
    config.json          # model, provider, toolScope (committed)
    .env                 # API keys, bot tokens (gitignored)
    sessions/            # conversation history (gitignored)
    recall.db            # semantic search index (gitignored)
```

Everything the agent needs is in this folder. Move it, zip it, clone it — the agent comes with it. Run `kern init` on any existing repo to adopt it as a kern agent.

## CLI

```bash
kern init <name>          # create or configure an agent
kern start [name|path]    # start agents in background
kern stop [name]          # stop agents
kern restart [name]       # restart agents
kern install [name|--web] # install systemd services (auto-restart, boot persistence)
kern uninstall [name]     # remove systemd services
kern tui [name]           # interactive chat
kern web <start|stop|status|token>  # web UI server
kern logs [name]          # follow agent logs
kern list                 # show all agents and web status
kern remove <name>        # unregister an agent
kern backup <name>        # backup agent to .tar.gz
kern restore <file>       # restore agent from backup
kern import opencode      # import session from OpenCode
```

Agents auto-register when you init, start, or run them. `kern list` shows every agent and the web daemon with running state and mode (systemd/daemon).

### Web UI

`kern web start` launches a web UI server (default port 9000). It prints a URL with an auth token — click it to connect.

```bash
kern web start    # start web UI, prints URL with token
kern web stop     # stop it
kern web status   # check if running
kern web token    # print the URL with token again
```

The web UI proxies all agent requests — agents bind to localhost only and are never exposed directly. Auth is handled at the proxy level with a single `KERN_WEB_TOKEN` (auto-generated, stored in `~/.kern/.env`).

Works over Tailscale or LAN. Add remote kern servers in the sidebar.

### Slash commands

Type these in any channel (TUI, Web, Telegram, Slack). Handled by the runtime — no LLM call, instant response.

```
/status     # agent status, model, uptime, session size
/restart    # restart the agent daemon
/help       # list available commands
```

## User pairing

The first person to message the bot becomes the operator — auto-paired, no code needed. Every user after pairs with a code:

1. Unknown user messages the bot → gets a `KERN-XXXX` code
2. User shares code with the operator
3. Operator approves: tell the agent, or `kern pair atlas KERN-XXXX` from CLI
4. Agent pairs them and writes USERS.md with identity and access notes

No allowlists. The agent manages its own access.

## Telegram

Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in `.kern/.env` and kern connects via long polling. No public URL needed — works behind NAT. Messages show up in real time in the TUI.

## Slack

Set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` in `.kern/.env`. Uses Socket Mode — no public URL needed.

- **DMs**: pairing required, same as Telegram
- **Channels**: agent reads all messages, only responds when @mentioned or relevant
- **NO_REPLY**: agent silently absorbs channel context without cluttering the conversation

Invite the bot to channels where it should listen.

## Memory

Agents remember across sessions through three mechanisms:

- **Files** — `knowledge/` for mutable state, `notes/` for daily logs. The agent reads and writes these through tools. Git-tracked, inspectable, portable.
- **Recall** — semantic search over all past conversations. Messages are embedded and stored in a local SQLite database (`recall.db`). The agent uses the `recall` tool to search by query with optional date filters, or load raw messages from a specific session.
- **Segments** — messages are automatically grouped into topic-coherent segments, summarized, and rolled up into a hierarchy (L0 → L1 → L2). When old messages are trimmed from context, compressed summaries are injected in their place — the agent sees its full conversation history at decreasing resolution.

On startup, the agent's system prompt is automatically injected with:
- The latest daily note (full content)
- An LLM-generated summary of the previous 5 daily notes
- Compressed conversation history from segments (when messages have been trimmed)

This means the agent boots with recent context — no manual reading required. Summaries are cached in SQLite and regenerated in the background on day rollover.

## Heartbeat

Kern sends a periodic `[heartbeat]` to the agent. The agent reviews notes, updates knowledge files, and messages the operator if something needs attention. Visible in the TUI only — Telegram and Slack never see it.

```json
{
  "heartbeatInterval": 60
}
```

Interval in minutes. Default 60 (1 hour). Set to 0 to disable.

## Logging

```bash
kern logs [name]              # follow logs (default)
kern logs [name] -n 50        # last 50 lines, exit
kern logs [name] --level warn # warnings and errors only
```

Structured, leveled logs with colored labels. Stored in `.kern/logs/kern.log`. All levels written, filter on read.

## Configuration

### Per-agent: `.kern/config.json`

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4.6",
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "toolScope": "full",
  "maxContextTokens": 50000,
  "maxToolResultChars": 20000,
  "historyBudget": 0.2
}
```

`maxContextTokens` controls the sliding context window — older messages are trimmed to stay within budget. `maxToolResultChars` caps individual tool results in context (full results stay in session JSONL and are searchable via recall). `historyBudget` controls what fraction of the context window is reserved for compressed segment summaries when old messages are trimmed (default 20%). Set to `0` to disable.

Agent auth tokens are auto-generated on first start and stored in `.kern/.env`. The web proxy injects them automatically — no manual setup needed.

### Global: `~/.kern/config.json`

```json
{
  "web_port": 9000,
  "web_host": "0.0.0.0"
}
```

Controls the `kern web` server. Optional — defaults apply if the file doesn't exist.

### Tool scopes

- **full** — shell (bash/pwsh), read, write, edit, glob, grep, webfetch, kern, message, recall
- **write** — read, write, edit, glob, grep, webfetch, kern, message, recall
- **read** — read, glob, grep, webfetch, kern, recall

Shell tool is platform-specific: `bash` on Unix/Linux, `pwsh` on Windows. Selected automatically.

### Providers

- **openrouter** — any model via OpenRouter (default)
- **anthropic** — direct Anthropic API
- **openai** — OpenAI / Azure
